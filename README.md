# Banking Application using Data Structures

## Description

Developed a banking application that handles a variety of transactions, including account management and funds transfer.

## Key Features

- **Input Handling**: The program reads transaction data from a file, assuming well-formed input with potential transaction-specific errors.
- **Client Account Management**: Supports up to ten funds per client, each identified by a unique 4-digit identifier, with an additional digit for fund type.
